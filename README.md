# Competitive Programming Website

I really like competitive programming, but I kinda suck at it. I also will need to get better at the things that competitive programming entails, such as data structures, algorithms, etc., for coding interviews, so I made this!

It is a website that features solutions to competitive programming problems I've already solved for the CCC, in Leetcode, and in CSES.

This is mainly for myself, because seeing the problems page get longer will kick off my dopamine receptors and make me want to do more Leetcode (big number good). For anyone who's viewing this and isn't me, I've also included some cool resources.

The website is a static been made with love (html, css, and js). The solutions themselves are all in C++ because C++ is fast.
